# Puzzle-Solver

This project is a puzzle game that consists of multiple levels, each with its own unique puzzle. The game is designed to work with two GameObjects in the scene:

1. Creator: This GameObject has a script attached to it that takes some information from you to automatically create a Level Prefab and Level Data Scriptable Object and saves them in folders.
2. Levels Manager: This GameObject has a script attached to it that creates a puzzle level in the game. To use it, you need to assign the required assets (Level Prefab, Scriptable Object, and Material) and then enable the Levels Manager.

To run the game in the Unity Editor, follow these steps:

1. Enable the Creator GameObject.
2. Assign references to the Level Prefab, Scriptable Object, and Material to the Levels Manager.
3. Enable the Levels Manager.
4. Enjoy the Puzzle game!
